# knapsack-problem
Contains knapsack problem formulation in 'pyomo' with sample data files.

# Installation
To run either knapsack problem, you will need to have/install

    - python (v2.7.9)
    - pyomo (an algebraic modeling language package for python)
    - glpk (a linear optimization solver; need 'glpsol' executable on your PATH variable)

and run the script, e.g. 'knapsackProblem.py', to get a simple output.

Have fun with it; hopefully this allows you to learn the basic syntax of pyomo in python!
